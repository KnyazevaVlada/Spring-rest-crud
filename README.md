# Spring-REST

I wrote CRUD project using Spring MVC, Hibernate, PostgreSQL, Maven. 
Project's configuratin here i made using Java-code (configuration package)
For testing project it's better to use Postman

Also I created a client part of this project, you can see it at "Spring-rest-crud-client" repository
